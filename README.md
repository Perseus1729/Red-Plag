# Softwares Used and Prerequisites

First Install Python3 which comes along with pip.<br />
The website uses Angular10 for the frontend and Django for the backend.<br />
The website is compatible with all versions of Python from Python3.<br />
The backend must me hosted from a pc which uses linux with g++ installed or you need WSL if you are using Windows.<br />
You need to install django-corheaders and django-rest api after installing django and matplotlib and numpy after insatlling python,using the commands<br /> 
And download the Doxygen GUI for Documentation of code
```diff
 python3 -m pip install django-cors-headers

 python3 -m pip install djangorestframework

 pip3 install numpy==1.19.3

 pip3 install matplotlib

```
### Refer to following links:
Angular:https://angular.io/guide/setup-local

Node JS:https://nodejs.org/en/download/

Django:https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/howto

Django-cors-headers:https://pypi.org/project/django-cors-headers/

Django-restapi:https://www.django-rest-framework.org/#installation

Doxygen-GUI   :http://www.doxygen.org/download.html
# Steps for Documentation
1.Created a temporary folder containing files modles.py and views.py<br />
2.Select this folder to Run the doxygen software on this folder it will generate a html folder and a LateX folder<br />
3.Now we can check our Html page from the files generated in that folder( or you can use the option "Show HTML page" in Doxyen GUI )<br />
4.For creating a Pdf file for our Documentation we go to the LateX directory generated by the Doxygen and use the command "**make**" ( in terminal )<br />
# Steps to run the code:
 ## Backend
 Clone the github repository using git clone https://github.com/mohithpokala/Project. 
 
 First Create a django-superuser.Go to the Directory containing manage.py("/Project/codefrisk/"), 
 now Run the following command in terminal " python manage.py createsuperuser ".<br />
 
 Follow the steps as prompted by the terminal.<br />
 
 After this step run the following three commands in the same sequence 
 ``` diff
  python manage.py makemigrations 
  python manage.py migrate 
  python manage.py runserver.
 ```
 Now You hosted the backend.
    
 # Frontend
 Migrate to the interface folder.

 Run 
 ``` diff 
 npm update   (To install node_modules)
 ng serve --open
 ```
 If you get a jquery error runn the followong commands on terminal.
    
       npm install jquery
       
       npm install bootstrap
 
 

# What has been implemented so far

    A basic framework for the website has been created.

    The Website incorporates five features:Login,Logout,Register,Upload,Download

    Implemented uploading of files for a user who has logged in.

    Basic implementation for downloading a file has been done.

    Core logic-wise a bag-of-words strategy along with tf-idf strategy after preprocesssing.

# The Theoretical Aspect

The two strategies we have attempted to implement here are:

### Bag of Words strategy:

For each document, a sorted vector of the word occurrences in the file are created. The cosine similarity between two vectors is returned as the degree of plagiarism.

###    Tf-idf:
This is slightly more polished than the Bag of Words strategy.We add a weight to each word based on how relavent the word is to the document.https://monkeylearn.com/blog/what-is-tf-idf/#:~:text=TF%2DIDF%20is%20a%20statistical,across%20a%20set%20of%20documents
